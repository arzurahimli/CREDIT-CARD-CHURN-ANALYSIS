# CREDIT CARD CHURN ANALYSIS 
Customer churn, or attrition, is the rate at which clients opt out of purchasing more of a company’s products or services. Customer churn analysis is a method of measuring this rate.

At a high level, churn analysis simply tells you what percentage of your customers don’t return compared with the percentage who conduct repeat business. By digging deeper into these numbers, you may be able to identify trends that can avert failure or take an already successful product or service to the next level.

## Tableau project link
In this project I analyzed the which customer has more tendency to churn. I grouped KPIs into 3 cattegories:
- Demographic based KPI
- Monetary based KPIs
- Relationship based KPI

## ***Demographic Based KPIs***
KPIs in this categories are Gender, Education level and Age group. Analysis of churn rate based on tihs KPIs is as follows: 

> - Churn rates of Famale and Male are approximately 44 percent and 41 percent respectively. 
>
> - About 21 percent of customers with doctorate degree tend to churn more.
>
> - Interesting point in the analyzing of churn by age group is that customer under 25 years old did not churn. On the other hand customers above 45 years old churn with the highest percentage in relation to other customers.

## ***Monetary Based KPIs***
Income level, Credit Limit and Utilization ratio are the main focus in this category

Based on the result of analysis:

> - Customers with low income and high income have more tendency to churn. About 17% of high income customers churned which is the higher than average churn rate. 
>
> - If customer's credit limit is  less than $5000, his/her probability of churning is higher than other customers. 
>
> - There is negative correlation  between Total Availible Credit and Utilization rate. Churn rate  of customers with low utilization ratio or high amount of availible credit  is  22.3 percent which is about 6 percent higher than average churn rate.

## ***Relationship Based KPIs***
In this part I analyzed churn rate based on the number of prduct which customer owns from the same bank and number of inactive time within the last 12 months.
Resuls are as follows:

> - As the number of  months customer is inactive increases, probability of churn increases. 
>
> - If customer own 2 or less products other than credit card from the same bank, it increases the churn rate of customer.
